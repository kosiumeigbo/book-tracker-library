<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A web application that gives users the ability to search, view and add books to their library. A book can only be in 4 states as shown below. The first 3 listed below are counted as being in a user's Library.

- Read (Finished)
- To Be Read (Not started)
- Currently Reading
- Not in Library

The user can quickly interact with the books, either through the books's main page or through the cards that show up when a book is searched.

### Built With

Built mainly with <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>SASS</strong>. I employed the concepts of web components to build reuseable components for the project.

I have deployed the website on Vercel.
